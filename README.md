### Advanced DPI Bypass & Selective Tunneling System (Optimized for Turkey)

TR-Gate Pro is a high-performance DPI bypass tool designed to overcome ISP-level filtering without causing speed loss or ping increase.

Unlike traditional VPN solutions, TR-Gate Pro only modifies traffic for selected domains, keeping the rest of your internet connection untouched.
